This is a basic turn based game, (it's not a rpg but my school said so...). You can controll any class you want between fighter, paladin, monk, berzerker and assassin, see details of each class below. *Have fun !*

nb: if you're on firefox, you should go to `about:config` and change `privacy.file_unique_origin` to false so it allows the html to have multiple js from different paths
